## Description
* This is my full-stack project using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (Material-UI for styling)
* This project is version two of my previous NBA_Player_Statistics project (version one can be found at: https://github.com/sdhaduk/NBA-Player-Statistics)
* I recreated this project because, even though I created version one recently, my knowledge of web development has increased exponentially and I wanted to know how much I could improve version one with the knowledge I have now.
